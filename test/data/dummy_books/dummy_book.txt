This is a text file that contains a "book" for testing purposes. Some of the lines and sentences are quite long and might need to be broken up to put on flashcards, because they use a large number of words without putting a full stop in between any of them, perhaps in order to emulate wise literary authors who seem to gravitate towards excessively long sentences, making it quite hard for non native speakers to read their work (or even native speakers, for that matter).
